Without further ado, let’s resume our tour of our JavaScript universe!

In the previous module, we’ve looked at primitive values: Undefined, Null, Booleans, Numbers, BigInts, and Strings. We will now introduce ourselves to non-primitive values—these are types that let us *make our own values*.

### Objects

![objects](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1580435620/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/objects.png)

At last, we got to objects!

This includes arrays, dates, RegExps, and other non-primitive values:

```js
console.log(typeof({})); // "object"
console.log(typeof([])); // "object"
console.log(typeof(new Date())); // "object"
console.log(typeof(/\d+/)); // "object"
console.log(typeof(Math)); // "object"
```

Unlike everything before, objects are *not* primitive values. This also means that by default, they’re mutable (we can change them). We can access their properties with `.` or `[]`:

```js
let rapper = { name: 'Malicious' };
rapper.name = 'Malice'; // Dot notation
rapper['name'] = 'No Malice'; // Bracket notation
```

We haven’t talked about properties in detail yet, so your mental model about them might be fuzzy. We will return to properties in a future module.

#### Making Our Own Objects

There is one thing in particular that makes objects exciting and unique. **We can make more of them! We can populate our JavaScript universe with our own objects.**

In our mental model, all of the primitive values we’ve discussed—`null`, `undefined`, booleans, numbers, and strings—have “always existed.” We can’t create a new string or a new number, we can only “summon” that value:

```js
let sisters = 3;
let musketeers = 3;
```

![Same number value](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1580435620/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/3sisters.png)

What makes objects different is that we *can* create more of them. **Every time we use the `{}` object literal, we *create* a brand new object value:**

```js
let shrek = {};
let donkey = {};
```

![Different object value](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1580435620/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/shrek-donkey.png)

The same goes for arrays, dates, and any other objects. For example, the `[]` array literal *creates* a new array value—a value that never existed before.

#### Do Objects Disappear?

You might wonder: do objects ever disappear, or do they hang around forever? JavaScript is designed in a way that we can’t tell one way or the other from inside our code. For example, we can’t *destroy* an object:

```js
let junk = {};
junk = null; // Doesn't necessarily destroy an object
```

Instead, JavaScript is a garbage-collected language.

This means that although we can’t destroy an object, it *might* eventually “disappear” if there is no way to reach it by following the wires from our code.

<Video src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/v1614267567/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/garbagecollection-optim-mp4.mp4" title="garbage collection" />

JavaScript doesn’t offer guarantees about *when* garbage collection happens.

Unless you’re trying to figure out why an app is using too much memory, you don’t need to think about garbage collection too often. I only mention it here so that you know that we can create objects—but we cannot destroy them.

*In our universe, objects and functions float closest to our code. This reminds us that we can manipulate them and even make more of them.*

### Functions

![functions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1580435620/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/functions.png)

We’ve reached the last stop on our tour!

It is particularly strange to think about functions as values that are separate from my code. After all, they *are* my code. Or are they not?

#### Functions are Values

We define functions so that we can call them later and run the code inside them. However, to really understand functions in JavaScript, we need to forget about *why* they’re useful for a second. Instead, we will think about functions as yet another kind of value: a number, an object, *a function*.

To understand functions, we will compare them to numbers and objects.

First, consider this `for` loop that runs `console.log(2)` seven times:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  console.log(2);
}
```

**How many different values does it pass to `console.log`?** To answer this, let’s recall what `2` means when we write it down. It is a number literal. A literal is an expression—a question to our universe. There is only one value for every number in our universe, so it “answers” our question by “summoning” the same value for the number `2` every time. **So the answer is one value.** We will see the log seven times—but we are passing the same value in each call.

Now let’s briefly revisit objects.

Here is another `for` loop that runs `console.log({})` seven times:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  console.log({});
}
```

**How many different values does it pass to `console.log` now?** Here, too, `{}` is a literal—except it’s an *object literal*. As we just learned, our JavaScript universe doesn’t “answer” an object literal by summoning anything. Instead, it *creates* a new object value—which will be the result of the `{}` object literal. **So the code above creates and logs seven completely distinct object values.**

Let that sink in.

Now have a look at functions.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  console.log(function() {});
}
```

**How many different values does this code pass to `console.log`?**

<HiddenAnswer byline="Don’t reveal until you have decided on an answer.">

The answer is seven.

**Every time we execute a line of code that contains a function expression, a brand new function value appears in our universe.**

<Video src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/video/upload/v1614267666/just-javascript-email-images/jj05/function-creation-optim-v2-mp4.mp4" title="Functions" />

Here, too, `function() {}` is an expression. Like any expression, a function expression is a “question” to our JavaScript universe—**which answers us by *creating* a new function value every time we ask**. This is very similar to how `{}` creates a new object value when it executes. Functions are like objects!

Technically, functions *are* objects in JavaScript. We’ll keep treating them as a separate fundamental type because they have unique capabilities compared to regular objects. But, generally speaking, if you can do something to an object, you can also do that to a function too. They are very special objects.

#### Calling a Function

What does this code print?

```js
let countDwarves = function() { return 7; };
let dwarves = countDwarves;
console.log(dwarves);
```

You might think that it prints `7`, especially if you’re not looking very closely.

Now check this snippet in the console! The exact thing it prints depends on the browser, but you will see *the function itself* instead of the number `7` there.

If you follow our mental model, this behavior should make sense:

1. First, we created a new function value with a `function() { }` expression, and pointed the `countDwarves` variable at this value.
2. Next, we pointed the `dwarves` variable at the value that `countDwarves` is pointing to—which is the same function value.
3. Finally, we logged the value that `dwarves` is currently pointing to.

*At no point, did we call our function!*

As a result, both `countDwarves` and `dwarves` point to the same value, which happens to be a function. See, *functions are values*. We can point variables to them, just like we can do with numbers or objects.

**Of course, if we want to *call* a function, we can do that too:**

```js
let countDwarves = function() { return 7; };
let dwarves = countDwarves(); // () is a function call
console.log(dwarves);
```

Note that neither the `let` declaration nor the `=` assignment have anything to do with our function call. It’s `()` that performs the function call—and it alone!

**Adding `()` changes the meaning of our code:**

* `let dwarves = countDwarves` means “Point `dwarves` to the value that `countDwarves` is currently pointing to.”
* `let dwarves = countDwarves()` means “Point `dwarves` to the value **returned by** the function that `countDwarves` is currently pointing to.”

In fact, `countDwarves()` is also an expression. It’s known as a *call expression*. To “answer” a call expression, JavaScript runs the code inside our function, and hands us the returned value as the result (in this example, it’s `7`).

## Recap

That was quite a journey! Over the last two modules, we have looked at every value type in JavaScript. Let’s recap each type of value that we encountered, starting with the different primitive types:

![Recap: different types of values](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1581383593/just-javascript-email-images/jj05/primitives-pt2-2.png)

* **Undefined**
* **Null**
* **Booleans**
* **Numbers**
* **BigInts**
* **Strings**
* **Symbols**

Then, there are the special types below, which let us *make our own values*:

![Recap: objects and functions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1580435620/just-javascript-email-images/jj04/summary-2.png)

* **Objects**
* **Functions**

It was fun to visit the different “celestial spheres” of JavaScript. Now that we’ve introduced ourselves to all the values, we’ve also learned what makes them *distinct* from one another.

Primitive values (strings, numbers, etc...), which we encountered in the first part of our tour, have always existed in our universe. **For example, writing `2` or `"hello"` always “summons” the same number or a string value. Objects and functions behave differently and allow us to generate our own values. Writing `{}` or `function() {}` always *creates* a brand new, different value.** This idea is crucial to understanding equality in JavaScript, which will be our next topic.

## Exercises

This module also has exercises for you to practice!

**Don’t skip them!**

Even though you’re probably familiar with different types of values, these exercises will help you cement the mental model we’re building. This foundation will help as you explore increasingly complex topics.
