  You'll receive emails from me (Dan Abramov) about Just JavaScript including
  the current rough drafts of each module. When you receive the drafts, please
  take the time to reply with your thoughts.

  <p>It is a huge help to me and the reason I'm sharing drafts like this.</p>
  <p>
    Also every email I send about Just JavaScript will have a handy unsubscribe
    link at the bottom. Please feel free to use it if you don't want to receive
    emails about this!
