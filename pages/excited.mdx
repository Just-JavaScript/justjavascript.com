  <p>It's great that you want to get started. I'm excited to share Just JavaScript with you.</p>

<p>Each module I send will have a short survey link.</p>

<p>If you can spare a few minutes, it's a big help if you fill them out. You can also reply to any of the emails that I send. I read all of them, and try to reply to as many as possible.</p>
