Hey there! 

I'm Dan Abramov.

During my first few years of using JavaScript, I felt like a fraud.

Even though I could build websites with frameworks, something was missing. I dreaded JavaScript job interviews because I didn't have a solid grasp on fundamentals.

The existing courses never felt quite right.

Some of them are visual and easy to follow, but sacrifice too many important nuances. Others were more thorough, but I couldn't get through them without falling asleep because they are tedious and boring.

They just don't work for me.

What if there were an online course that could better prepare you to understand JavaScript, but wasn't a grueling march to get through?

**Just JavaScript** is that course.

The one I wish I had.

If you already know at least the basics of JavaScript, this course will help you feel more confident in your knowledge as a developer.

This course is **my distilled mental model of how JavaScript works**.

I want to share it with you.

Just JavaScript is a work in progress that exists as a series of free emails. 
Over time these emails will evolve into an in-depth, interactive, fun, multimedia course that explains these powerful mental models for programming with JavaScript.

And you can help...

**I will send you drafts of __Just JavaScript__ directly to your inbox for free**. 

There's no editing. No polish. It's more like a conversation we would have together over a cup of coffee.

By subscribing I will add you to my email list and send a sequence of emails describing my JavaScript mental models. This will eventually be a paid course, but you can unsubscribe at any time and for now it is completely free.
All I ask is that you reply to the emails and share your opinions and experience. Let me know if these models resonate with you. Tell me how **you** think about JavaScript.

For now, this email list is the only way to access Just JavaScript. They won't be published here or elsewhere on the web and I ask that you don't share them.
These ideas are raw and fragile, and for now I'm not ready to share them widely.
