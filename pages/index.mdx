# Go from shaky fundamentals and kind-of-sort-of-knowing JavaScript, to a rock-solid understanding

## Build a foundation you can rely upon for the rest of your career.

You know enough JavaScript syntax to get by.

Conditionals, const vs let, arrow functions, classes...

You get things done. You ship features. You know you "should" go back and brush up on the fundamentals. At some point. When you find the time.

You've bought a few thick books on JavaScript, skimmed through endless videos on YouTube, and are still hoarding that 40-hour video course you got on sale but haven't found time to watch yet.

None of these really work for you.

It feels like a treadmill of studying rote facts. Endless miles of technical speak and abstract concepts. All without knowing whether you fully grokked the concept.

## You don't feel like you can truly _think_ in JavaScript.

That's the real difference between beginners and experienced developers.

It's not that you don't want to improve your skills and understanding of JavaScript.
You've tried.

You know which parts of JavaScript are good and which parts are... not so great.

You already know JavaScript. Sort of.

But then it hits you...
- Right before an interview
- Troubleshooting a complex bug
- Pairing with a more experienced developer...

JavaScript's weird side rears its ugly head and presents an edge case that you weren't expecting.

Page 242 of that JavaScript textbook hasn't taught you what you need to know in this moment. Pure syntax isn't enough to solve the problem at hand.

It feels like a physical gap in your knowledge – the gaping hole between technical details, and how to assemble JavaScript's parts together to solve real problems for real users.

It's a hole that could be filled if you just had time to study more, work on more side projects, and do the work needed to understand JavaScript at a deeper level. To know it the way you know how to run without thinking about muscle mechanics.

## But you don't have time for that.

You don't have time to read a 1200 page book on this year's EMCAScript specification.

Even if you did have time, the dry explanations in it wouldn't even address the core problem. You need to understand how to apply syntax in context to solve real problems. At your real job (or at the job you wish you had).

And a 40 hour video course? Good luck skipping past all the intros, outros, and repetition to find the 10 minutes of useful content in the whole thing.

It feels like something is missing. It feels like there are untold secrets hidden away and securely guarded to prevent the rest of us from opening the gates.

## What if there were an online course that could truly teach you to understand JavaScript?

What if it wasn't a gruelling, boring slog of repetitive jargon and syntax to wade through?

What if there was a way to advance your JavaScript skills through visual explanations and fun, addictive exercises that actually show you what the code is doing?

What if you could learn the fundamental patterns needed to solve problems on your own?

What if filling in the gaps in your JavaScript mental models was actually enjoyable and rewarding?

## Just JavaScript is that course.

### Through intuitive visual explanations and learning challenges, you'll completely reframe your understanding of JavaScript.

It's a learning experience that goes far beyond boring syntax. We’ll show you what happens inside an expert's head when they read code.

Deep beneath your understanding of JavaScript's syntax is a set of mental models you've unconsciously built.

They're the way you think all the parts of JavaScript fit together.

Every time you go about assembling variables, functions, and expressions – hoping to produce programs that solve real-world problems – your invisible models are running the show.

They're dictating how you compose your code. Where you store things. How you pass objects around.

When we build software we aren't trying to create the most beautiful, eloquent JavaScript applications. We're focused on delivering real value to users in a way that is efficient and as error free as possible.

Just JavaScript has been crafted to help you do just that.

It's not a course about clean code or tips and tricks.

This course will help you think and reason more clearly about the software that you write and how you can approach problems in an effective and efficient manner.

### Just JavaScript is designed to give you confidence in your abilities.

This isn't a course created for beginners. It’s for people who already know JavaScript, but are held back by their misconceptions about the language. We help you relearn the topics you thought you knew. It is your key to unlock the gates and advance your career as a developer.

- No more doubting yourself before an interview
- No more frantic panic when you're assigned a critical bug fix
- No more cold sweats before submitting a PR to a senior developer

And gaining these new abilities won't even feel like a chore.

You won't be reading walls of text or sitting through hours of video.

Every lesson is built around animated explanations that walk you through the concepts.

You'll immediately put your understanding to the test with interactive quizzes baked into every lesson.

##  About the Creator

Hi, I'm Dan Abramov.

I've worked on multiple open source projects in the JavaScript ecosystem that you might have used, including React.

I made Just JavaScript because it's the course I wish I had when I got started.

It's my distilled mental model of how JavaScript works – a way of thinking about JS that will completely shift your understanding of the language.

When I started thinking about how to explain it, I knew this needed to be a visual experience. So I teamed up with illustrator [Maggie Appleton](http://maggieappleton.com/) to make it happen.

We've built an experience that will teach you to see JavaScript in a whole new light. It's a unique interactive learning environment based around explorable explanations. Nothing about this course is a passive experience!

You'll reconsider what you thought you knew about the language, and come away with an intuitive understanding that helps you solve problems and deliver real value to people.

## The Technical Details

The first season of Just JavaScript consists of eight individual episodes for you to learn from. You'll start with the basics and learn about mental models and then we will progress through the JavaScript Universe and explore how the different mental models fit together to create working programs.

- Mental models
- The JavaScript universe
- Values and variables
- Counting the values
- Equality of values
- Properties
- Mutations
- Prototypes
