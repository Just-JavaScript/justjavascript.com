### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the `ship` variable pointing to an object, whose `name` property points to a string.

Diagram A is wrong because it doesn't show the object value to which the `ship` variable is pointing.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows the string *inside* our object. In our mental model, object properties *point* to other values, not contain them.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows `ship.name` as being a variable in code. However, it is a property and belongs to an object.

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows the `captain` variable pointing to `"Naomi"`. It also shows the `ship` variable pointing to an object whose `captain` property points to `"Jim"`.

Diagrams A and B are wrong because they show the `captain` variable and the `captain` property of our object pointing to the same value. However, line 3 changed the variable alone.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows a property pointing to a variable, which is not possible. Properties point at values.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the `turner` and `kamal` variables pointing to two different objects. Each of these objects have a `name` property that points to the same value `"Alex"`.

![https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1612905183/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/Quiz%20Images/jjs-07-03-b.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1612905183/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/Quiz%20Images/jjs-07-03-b.png)

Diagram A doesn't match our mental model because it shows the string value `"Alex"` twice. In our universe, there is only one value for every distinct string.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows only one object value. However, every `{ }` object literal creates a different object value, so we should have two of them.

Diagram D is wrong because it doesn't show objects at all.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows the `sand` variable pointing to an empty object. It also shows the `ice` variable pointing to an object with a `taste` property that itself points to the `undefined` value. The `answer` points to `true`.

Here, `ice.taste` is `undefined` because `ice.taste` points at the `undefined` value.

However, `sand.taste` is also `undefined` — because **the rules say** that if a property doesn't exist, the value of the property expression is the `undefined` value. The object `sand` points to doesn't have a `taste` property, so the _result of_ the `sand.taste` expression is `undefined`.

We have `undefined` on both sides of `===`. There is only one `undefined` value in our universe — so they must be equal and the `answer` is `true`.

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows the `singer` and the `pilot` variables pointing to two different objects. Each of these objects have a `surname` property that points to the same value `"Kamal"`.

If you got a different answer, you might have either forgotten to approach the problem step by step, or forgot what reading or writing a property does.

To execute `singer.surname = pilot.surname`, we needed to take the `singer.surname` wire, and point it to the same value that `pilot.surname` was currently pointing to (`"Kamal"` at the time). Now both of them point to `"Kamal"`.

Then, when we execute `pilot.surname = singer.surname`, we take the `pilot.surname` wire, and point it to where `singer.surname` is pointing to (`"Kamal"` due to the previous step). So both of them still point to `"Kamal"`.

## For Real This Time

**Can you figure out** the three lines of code necessary to swap the values of the surname properties of these two objects?

If you get stuck and your physical form allows that, take something large into each hand and then try to swap the items in your hands. You might find it difficult unless you put one of them somewhere temporarily. Hint: in code, that "somewhere" can be a variable.

```js
let singer = {surname: 'Turner'};
let pilot = {surname: 'Kamal'};
// ??? line 1 ???
// ??? line 2 ???
// ??? line 3 ???
console.log(singer.surname); // "Kamal"
console.log(pilot.surname); // "Turner"
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

Our problem is that we can't point two wires to different values in one line. We can only change where one of them points at a time.

However, we can introduce a variable to "hold onto" the value of one of those wires. Then we can change where that wire points to without "forgetting" where the other wire needs to be pointed.

This is similar to how in order to swap two things in your hands, you can give the first thing to your friend to hold, put the second thing in the first hand, and then take the first thing back from your friend.

If you're still confused, you can sketch out this example step by step.

```js
let singer = { surname: 'Turner' };
let pilot = { surname: 'Kamal' };
let savedSingerSurname = singer.surname;
singer.surname = pilot.surname;
pilot.surname = savedSingerSurname;

### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows the `president` variable pointing to an object. That object's `name` property points to `"Pooh"`. Its next property points to another object. The second object's `name` property points to `"Paddington"`. The second object also has a `next` property, which points back to our first object!

If you got a different answer, you might have either forgotten to approach the problem step by step, or forgot what reading or writing a property does.

To execute `president.next = { ... }`, we attached the first object's `next` property wire to the second object we created.

When inside of the second object literal, `next: president` meant that the newly created object’s `next` property should point to the value of the `president` variable at the time — which was our first object.

This is why the first and the second object’s `next` properties point at the other object in a cycle. If you’d like, run this example in the console and expand the `next` property a few times! How many times can you do it?...

<Answer>

Here is one possible answer.

```js
let president = { name: 'Pooh' };
president.next = president;
```

Note that `let president = { next: president }` would not work.

Assignment happens in three steps: (1) find the wire on the left, (2) find the value on the right, (3) point the wire to that value.

By the time we create the `{ next: president }` object (step 2), we haven’t yet pointed `president` variable anywhere (step 3), so we can’t use it yet!

So instead, we create our object and assign it to the `president` variable first. Then, we point the `next` property wire from that object to itself.

Good news for us, bad news for democracy!

To check your solution, paste it into the console and expand the `next` property. You should be able to expand it forever.

## Who Dat Boy

What is the result of running this code?

```js
let station = {
  Owner: { name: 'Fred' },
};
let name = station.owner.name;
console.log(name === station.Owner.name);
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**This code crashes.**

When we execute `let name = station.owner.name`, we want to point the `name` wire to the result value of `station.owner.name`.

To calculate `station.owner.name`, we want to know `station.owner` first. The object that `station` points to doesn’t have a property called `owner`. (It has a property called `Owner`, which is a different property because their names are case-sensitive.) So, according to our rules, the *result of* the `station.owner` expression is `undefined`.

But if `station.owner` is `undefined`, then it cannot appear on the left side of a dot. Calculating `station.owner.name` produces an error and the code stops executing.

If this is confusing, take another look at the Missing Properties section.

```js
let station = {
  Owner: { name: 'Fred' },
};
//            undefined
