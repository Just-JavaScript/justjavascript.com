### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows `dwarves` and `worldWonders` pointing to the `7` number value, and `continents` variable pointing to the `"7"` string value.

Diagram B is wrong because `7` and `"7"` are two different values — one is a number, and another one is a string. They are not the same value.

Diagram C doesn’t match our mental model because it shows the value `7` more than once. In our mental model, there is only one value for each distinct number.

Diagram D is wrong because a variable can’t point to another variable. It must point to a value.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows `bees` and `peas` pointing to one object value, and `knees` variable pointing to another object value.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows `peas` pointing to something that isn’t a value. A variable must point to a value.

Diagram B doesn’t match our mental model because it shows all variables pointing at the same value. However, `{}` creates a different object every time.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows three objects. However, only two objects were created in this code example. Remember that `=` only points the variable on the left to the value of the expression on the right. That’s all it does.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows `banana` and `result` pointing to the same function value.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows them pointing to two different function values. However, we ran only one `function() {}` declaration, so only one function value was created.

Diagrams B and C are wrong because they show the `result` variable pointing to the value `4`. However, there was no function call, so the code inside the function is irrelevant.

Remember that `=` only means “connect the wire on the left to the value of expression on the right”. Since `banana` is pointing to a function value, `let result = banana` will make result point to the same value.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the `ask` variable pointing to a function value, and `halves` and `weeks` variables pointing at the value `2`.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows multiple values for the number `2`. In our mental model, each number only exists once.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows all variables pointing to the function value. However, `halves` and `weeks` should point to `2` because it’s the result of calling our function that gets assigned to them. That result is `2`.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows the ask variable pointing to `2`. However, it should be pointing to the function value that’s assigned to it.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram C is correct.** It shows the `plant` variable pointing a function value, while `tree` and `flower` point to two different object values.

Diagram A doesn’t match our mental model because it shows three regular objects. Throughout this course, we’re going to distinguish functions as a separate type from regular objects.

Diagram B is wrong because it shows `tree` and `flower` pointing to the same object. However, `return {}` runs twice — once for each function call — and so two different objects get created.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows all variables pointing to the same function value. However, the right side of the last two assignments included `()`, which indicates a function call. So `tree` and `flower` should point to the respective returned values rather than to the function itself.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows the `cook` and `make` variables pointing to two different function values, while `food` and `fuel` variables are pointing to the same string value.

Diagrams B and C are wrong because they show `cook` and `make` pointing to the same function value. However, every time we execute `function() {}`, JavaScript creates a brand new function value. So they should point to different functions.

Diagram D doesn’t match our mental model because it shows two different `"tofu"` string values. However, in our mental model there is only one value for every distinct string.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the `spaghetti` and `fettucine` variables pointing to the same function value, and `gnocchi` pointing to another function value.

Diagrams A and C are wrong because they show `fettucine` pointing to the value `4`. However, `fettucine` only points to a function value. We never called that function, so what it returns is irrelevant.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows all the variables pointing to the same function. However, each `function() {}` creates a new function value. So `spaghetti` and `gnocchi` should point at different function values.
