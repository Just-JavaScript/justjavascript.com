# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows dwarves and _worldWonders_ pointing to the 7 number value, and continents variable pointing to the _"7"_ string value.

Diagram B is wrong because 7 and "7" are two different values — one is a number, and another one is a string. They are not the same value.

Diagram C doesn’t match our mental model because it shows the value 7 more than once. In our mental model, there is only one value for each distinct number.

Diagram D is wrong because a variable can’t point to another variable. It must point to a value.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows bees and peas pointing to one object value, and knees variable pointing to another object value.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows peas pointing to something that isn’t a value. A variable must point to a value.

Diagram B doesn’t match our mental model because it shows all variables pointing at the same value. However, {} creates a different object every time.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows three objects. However, only two objects were created in this code example. Remember that = only points the variable on the left to the value of the expression on the right. That’s all it does.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows banana and result pointing to the same function value.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows them pointing to two different function values. However, we ran only one `function() {}` declaration, so only one function value was created.

Diagrams B and C are wrong because they show the `result` variable pointing to the value 4. However, there was no function call, so the code inside the function is irrelevant.

Remember that `=` only means “connect the wire on the left to the value of expression on the right”. Since `banana` is pointing to a function value, `let result = banana` will make result point to the same value.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the ask variable pointing to a function value, and halves and weeks variables pointing at the value 2.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows multiple values for the number 2. In our mental model, each number only exists once.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows all variables pointing to the function value. However, halves and weeks should point to 2 because it’s the result of calling our function that gets assigned to them. That result is 2.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows the ask variable pointing to 2. However, it should be pointing to the function value that’s assigned to it.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram C is correct.** It shows the plant variable pointing a function value, while tree and flower point to two different object values.

Diagram A doesn’t match our mental model because it shows three regular objects. Throughout this course, we’re going to distinguish functions as a separate type from regular objects.

Diagram B is wrong because it shows tree and flower pointing to the same object. However, return {} runs twice — once for each function call — and so two different objects get created.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows all variables pointing to the same function value. However, the right side of the last two assignments included (), which indicates a function call. So tree and flower should point to the respective returned values rather than to the function itself.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows the cook and make variables pointing to two different function values, while food and fuel variables are pointing to the same string value.

Diagrams B and C are wrong because they show cook and make pointing to the same function value. However, every time we execute function() {}, JavaScript creates a brand new function value. So they should point to different functions.

Diagram D doesn’t match our mental model because it shows two different "tofu" string values. However, in our mental model there is only one value for every distinct string.

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the spaghetti and fettucine variables pointing to the same function value, and gnocchi pointing to another function value.

Diagrams A and C are wrong because they show fettucine pointing to the value 4. However, fettucine only points to a function value. We never called that function, so what it returns is irrelevant.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows all the variables pointing to the same function. However, each function() {} creates a new function value. So spaghetti and gnocchi should point at different function values.
