### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows all variables pointing to the value 4.

All other diagrams show more than a single value 4. But in our mental model, there is only one number value for each number!

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows the price variable pointing to 200, and the offer variable pointing to 101.

If you arrived at a different result, you might want to try again. Remember that = means "connect the wire of variable on the left to the current value on the right", and nothing more than that.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is correct.** It shows both `soap` and `shampoo` variables pointing to the `undefined` value.

Diagram B is wrong because it shows the `undefined` value twice. There is only one `undefined` value in our universe.

Diagram C and Diagram D are both wrong because the `shampoo` variable doesn’t point to any value. After a variable is declared, it always points to a value. And if you don’t specify where it should point, it will point to `undefined`!

### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram C is correct.** It shows all variables except `isConfusing` pointing to the `true` value, and `isConfusing` pointing to the `false` value.

Diagram A is wrong because variables should point to values, not expressions.

Diagram B is wrong because in our mental model, there is only one `true`, and only one `false` value.

Diagram D is wrong because the values are calculated incorrectly. In particular, `isSad` was `false` at the time we calculated `isHappy`. Therefore, `!isSad` was `true` in that moment, and that's why we pointed `isHappy`'s wire to `true`. We never changed `isHappy`'s wire again, so it still points to `true`.
