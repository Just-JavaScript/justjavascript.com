<Quiz title="JJS 03 Values and Variables" id="values-and-variables" version="1">

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 01 numberOfTentacles code">

<Prompt>

# What happens if we run this code?

Is this code valid? Why or why not?

```js
let numberOfTentacles = 10
numberOfTentacles = 'eight'
console.log(typeof numberOfTentacles)
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Yes, it’s valid. It prints "string" to the console.**

Variables don’t have types in JavaScript — only values do. The answer to typeof(numberOfTentacles) depends on **which value** the variable was pointing to at that time.

The numberOfTentacles variable was pointing to "eight" string value at the time we asked about its type. So we got "string" as a result.

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 02 numberOfTentacles output">

<Prompt>

# Here's a slightly different example. What happens if we run it?

Is there a difference in behavior compared to the last snippet? Explain why or why not using our mental model.

```js
let numberOfTentacles = 10;
console.log(typeof(numberOfTentacles);
numberOfTentacles = 'eight';
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Yes, there is a difference. It prints "number" to the console.**

Variables don’t have types in JavaScript — only values do. The answer to typeof(numberOfTentacles) depends on **which value** the variable was pointing to at that time.

The numberOfTentacles variable was pointing to 10 number value at the time we asked about its type. So we got "number" as a result.

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 03 answer.opposite">

<Prompt>

# What happens if we run this code?

Explain why using our mental model.

```js
let answer = true
answer.opposite = false
console.log(answer.opposite)
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**This code won’t be able to set a property.**

Booleans are primitive. And primitive values are immutable. We can’t change them — and setting a property on a value is a change.

If our code runs in the [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), assigning a property on a primitive value would lead to an error. Otherwise, it will silently do nothing. In either case, we can’t set a property on a boolean value like _true_.

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 04 null equals 10">

<Prompt>

# What happens if we run this code?

Explain why using our mental model.

```js
null = 10
console.log(null)
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**This code produces an error.**

It is an error because the left side of the assignment must always be a “wire”. Variables are “wires”, so they can appear on the left side. A literal like _null_ is not a “wire”, so trying to assign something to it is meaningless.

<Prompt>

# Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** It shows both variables pointing at the same "eat cake" string value.

Diagram A doesn’t match the mental model we’re building. It shows values inside variables, but in our mental model variables point to values.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows a variable pointing to another variable. Variables can only point to values, not to other variables.

Diagram D is wrong for both of the same reasons.

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 07 feed pets">

<Prompt>

This code prints **_"T"_** to the console. The **_feed_** function is written by our colleague **in another file.** We don't know what it does.

```js
let pets = 'Tom and Jerry'
feed(pets)
console.log(pets[0])
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**No, our colleague cannot make this code log something other than _"T"_.**

This is because when we call a function, we always pass a value, not a variable. We’re passing a string value — and **strings, like any primitives, are immutable.** Our colleague can’t mess with the "Tom and Jerry" string value, so its first character will always be _'T'_.

</Answer>

</Question>

<Question type="EssayQuestion" id="JJS 03 08 What does feed do">

<Prompt>

This code prints **_"Tom"_** to the console. The **_feed_** function is written by our colleague **in another file.** We don't know what it does.

```js
let pets = ['Tom', 'Jerry']
feed(pets)
console.log(pets[0])
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Yes, our colleague can make this code log something other than _"Tom"_.**

Note that our colleague can’t change which value our variable points to. We pass a value — not a variable! However, our colleague can affect the array value itself, and change its elements.

This is because **arrays, unlike strings, are mutable.** They are not primitive values — they are objects! In case you forget, here is a reminder of which values are primitive. Anything not on this list is an object, and our colleague can affect it.
