<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof">

<Prompt>

## Open some JavaScript project or snippet that you have been working on

Put `console.log(typeof(something))` into your code, replacing `something` with different variables in your code. Take your time, I’ll wait! We’re not in a rush.

**Which value types did you manage to find an example for?** Try to “collect” as many types as you can. Did any of the results surprise you?

</Prompt>

null

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof date">

<Prompt>

## Imagine you see some code that checks whether a value is a Date

The check looks like this: `typeof(value) === 'date'`.

Will this code do what the author intended? Why or why not?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**This code will not work.**

**`typeof(value) === "date"` is always `false`.**

This is because `"date"` is not one of the possible `typeof` results. Dates are _not_ one of the primitive types (unlike numbers and booleans), and they are also _not_ functions. So `typeof` a JavaScript Date can only be an `"object"`.

You don’t need to know anything about JavaScript Dates to answer this question. It is enough to know the `typeof` values!

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof lie">

<Prompt>

## Find the liar

Out of the nine value types, one is a liar. When you use the `typeof` operator on a value of that type, **it gives a wrong answer** because of a bug in JavaScript.

Do you know which value it is? You can find this value by trying `typeof` for each example in our list of nine types. Here they are, in case you need a recap:

- **Undefined** (`undefined`), used for unintentionally missing values.
- **Null** (`null`), used for intentionally missing values.
- **Booleans** (`true` and `false`), used for logical operations.
- **Numbers** (`-100`, `3.14`, and others), used for math calculations.
- **BigInts** (uncommon and new), used for math on big numbers.
- **Strings** (`"hello"`, `"abracadabra"`, and others), used for text.
- **Symbols** (uncommon), used to perform rituals and hide secrets.
- **Objects** (`{}` and others), used to group related data and code.
- **Functions** (`x => x * 2` and others), used to refer to code.

Who is the liar?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**null is the value that "lies" about its type.**

Concretely, `typeof(null)` is `"object"` even though **null is [not](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-null-type) an object**. Null is a primitive value. (Here’s a [historical note](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html) on how that happened.) This is a very old bug in JavaScript. It cannot be fixed because fixing it would break a lot of existing code that, for better or worse, already relies on this quirk.

You might ask: isn’t `typeof([]) === "object"` a bug? No. Arrays aren’t primitive, so they are objects! So are dates, and everything not on our list. Unlike null, they’re telling the truth.

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof typeof">

<Prompt>

## A type of a type

No matter what `value` we pick, we know that `typeof(value)` can only give us one of the several predetermined answers like `"number"`, `"string"`, and so on. What can say with a similar certainty about `typeof(typeof(value))`?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**`typeof(typeof(value))` is always `"string"`.**

Here’s why. We know `typeof(value)` always gives us one of the predetermined strings: `"undefined"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, and so on. Predetermined *strings*.

So `typeof` any of them is `"string"`. Because they’re strings!

If you struggle with this idea, perhaps, you’re not reading this code in the right order. Nesting means that the `typeof` “inside” executes before the one “outside”, like this:

```
// This is the one inside:
let type1 = typeof(value);
// Could be "number", "string", "object", ...
// But these are all strings!

// This is the one outside:
let type2 = typeof(type1);
// Can only be "string" because type1 is a string
```
