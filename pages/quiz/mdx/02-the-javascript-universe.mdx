<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof">

<Prompt>

## Open some JavaScript code that you have been working on and put **`console.log(typeof(something))`** in it, replacing something with different variables in your code.

Which value types did you manage to find an example for? Try to “collect” as many types as you can.

</Prompt>

null

</Question>

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof date">

<Prompt>

## Imagine you see some code that checks whether a value is a date: **`typeof(value) === 'date'`**

Will this code work? Why or why not?

</Prompt>

null

</Question>

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof lie">

<Prompt>

## One of the values mentioned in this module “lies” about its type. Concretely, `typeof` will return an incorrect answer for it because of a JavaScript bug that is now too late to fix.

### Do you know which value it is? You can find this value by trying typeof for each example in our list of nine types.

### Primitive Values

- **Undefined** (`undefined`), used for unintentionally missing values.
- **Null** (`null`), used for intentionally missing values.
- **Booleans** (`true` and `false`), used for logical operations.
- **Numbers** (`-100`, `3.14`, and others), used for math calculations.
- **Strings** (`"hello"`, `"abracadabra"`, and others), used for text.
- **Symbols** (uncommon), used to hide implementation details.
- **BigInts** (uncommon and new), used for math on big numbers.

### Objects and Functions

- **Objects** (`{}` and others), used to group related data and code.
- **Functions** (`x => x * 2` and others), used to refer to code.

<Answer>

**null is the value that "lies" about its type.**

Concretely, `typeof(null)` is "object" even though null is not an object. Null is a primitive value. (Here’s a historical note on how that happened.) This is a very old bug in JavaScript. It cannot be fixed because it would break existing websites.

You might ask: isn’t `typeof([]) === "object"` a bug? No. Arrays aren’t primitive, so they are objects! Unlike null, they’re telling the truth.

<Question kind="EssayQuestion" desc="typeof typeof">

<Prompt>

## No matter what **value** we pick, we know that **`typeof(value)`** can only give us one of the several predetermined answers.

Is there anything similarly interesting that we can say about **`typeof(typeof(value))`**?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**typeof(typeof(value)) is always "string".**

Here’s why. We know typeof(value) always gives us one of the predetermined strings: "undefined", "boolean", "number", and so on. Predetermined strings.

So typeof any of them is "string". Because they’re strings!
