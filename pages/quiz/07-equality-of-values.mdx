### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is correct.** All variables point to the same `"mustache"` string value.

None of the other diagrams match our mental model because they show more than one `"mustache"` string value. In our universe, every distinct string only exists once.

Now **use this sketch** to determine the output of:

1. `console.log(fingernails === toes);`
2. `console.log(toes === nose);`
3. `console.log(nose === fingernails);`

Hint: usually, `a === b` when `a` and `b` point to the same value.

<Answer>

All of these examples print `true`.

1. `fingernails === toes`: This is `true` because `fingernails` and `toes` point at the same string.
2. `toes === nose`: This is `true` because `toes` and `nose` point at the same string.
3. `nose === fingernails`: This is `true` because `nose` and `fingernails` point at the same string.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram C is correct.** It shows each variable pointing at a different object value.

Remember that `{}` means “create a new object value”, and `let x = y` means “point `x`’s wire to the current value of `y`”. If you follow each line of code in this example step by step, you will arrive at the same result.

If you’d like, verify your answer in the browser console. Hint: you might find `===` or `Object.is` helpful to check your answer against the diagram.

# You Shall Not Pass

The author of this code expects it to print a message. **Will the message appear?**

Use our mental model to answer this. Make a sketch if you’d like!

```js
let ticket = { id: 0 };
if (ticket === { id: 0 }) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**No, the message will not appear.**

When we “ask” `ticket === { id: 0 }`, we need to figure out what value is on each side of `===`. On the left side, we have `ticket`, whose value is the object we created on the first line by writing `{ id: 0 }`. On the right side, we have a `{ id: 0 }` object literal — which also creates a completely new value!

We have **different object values on each side of `===`**. So the check will **not** pass, and the function will **not** print our message.

```js
let ticket = { id: 0 };
if (ticket === { id: 0 }) { // false
  console.log('Bad ticket'); // Will not run.
}
```

# All Things Must Pass

The author of this code expects it to print a message. **Will the message appear?**

Use our mental model to answer this. Make a sketch if you’d like!

```js
let ticketId = 0;
if (ticketId === 0) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Yes, the message will appear.**

When we “ask” `ticketId === 0`, we need to figure out what value is on each side of `===`. On the left side, we have `ticketId`, which points to the number value `0`. On the right side, we have the `0` literal — which also results in the number value `0`.

There is only one number value `0` in our universe, and **we have that same value on both sides of `===`.** The check **will** pass, and the function **will** print our message.

```js
let ticketId = 0;
if (ticketId === 0) { // true
  console.log('Bad ticket'); // Will run!
}
```

# Twin Shadow

Can you think of a different value than `0` that would also cause a message to be printed?

```js
let ticketId = ???;
if (ticketId === 0) {
  console.log('Bad ticket');
}
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The other value that would cause the message to be printed is `-0`.**

Even though `0` and `-0` are two different values, `===` considers them equal.

### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram D is correct.** It shows `tea` and `coffee` pointing to two different function values, while `matcha` and `latte` are pointing to the same `NaN` value.

Diagram A is wrong because it shows `matcha` and `latte` pointing to two different `NaN` values. In our universe, there is only one `NaN` value.

Diagrams B and C are wrong because they show `tea` and `coffee` pointing to the same value. Each function definition creates a new value, so `tea` and `coffee` should point to two different values.

As a reminder, `NaN` is a special numeric value that represents an invalid result — like when you try to calculate `0 / 0`.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Only `Object.is(matcha, latte)` is `true`, all the other answers are `false`.**

1. `tea === coffee`: This is `false` because `tea` and `coffee` point at two different function values.
2. `Object.is(tea, coffee)`: This is `false` because `tea` and `coffee` point at two different function values.
3. `matcha === latte`: This is `false` because both of them point at `NaN`, and `NaN === NaN` is always `false`. (If you forgot about this, you can re-read the section about special cases of Strict Equality.)
4. `Object.is(matcha, latte)`: This is `true` because `matcha` and `latte` point at the same `NaN` number value.
