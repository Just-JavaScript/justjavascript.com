## What happens if we run this code?

Is this code valid? Why or why not?

```js
let numberOfTentacles = 10
numberOfTentacles = 'eight'
console.log(typeof numberOfTentacles)
```

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Yes, it’s valid. It prints "string" to the console.**

Variables don’t have types in JavaScript — only values do. The answer to `typeof(numberOfTentacles) `depends on **which value** the variable was pointing to at that time.

The `numberOfTentacles` variable was pointing to "eight" string value at the time we asked about its type. So we got "string" as a result.

<Prompt>

## Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

### Diagram B is correct. It shows all variables pointing to the value 4.

All other diagrams show more than a single value 4. But in our mental model, there is only one number value for each number!
