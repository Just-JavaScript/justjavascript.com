## Gotta Log ’Em All

Open some JavaScript project that you have been working on.

Add `console.log(typeof(something))`, replacing `something` with different variables in your code. **Write down the value types you found in your project.**

Try to “collect” as many types as you can. Did any of the results surprise you?

</Prompt>

null

## A Sketchy Date

You found a piece of code that checks whether `value` is a JavaScript Date:

```js
if (typeof(value) === 'date') {
  console.log('This is a date, indeed!');
}
```

Will this code do what the author intended? Explain why or why not.

*You don’t need to know much about Dates to answer this question.*

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**This code will not work.**

**`typeof(value) === "date"` is always `false`.**

You can tell this by the process of elimination:

* Dates are _not_ one of the primitive types we’ve mentioned (such as Undefined, Null, Numbers, Booleans, and so on).
* They are also _not_ functions.

Like everything that didn’t have a separate section on our list, Dates are Objects. So `typeof` a JavaScript Date is `"object"`.

```js
let today = new Date();
console.log(typeof(today)); // "object"
```

## Liar Liar, Pants on Fire

Out of the nine value types, one is a liar. When you use the `typeof` operator on a value of that type, **it gives a wrong answer** because of a bug in JavaScript.

Do you know which value it is? You can find this value by trying `typeof` for each example in our list of nine types. Here they are, in case you need a recap:

- **Undefined** (`undefined`)
- **Null** (`null`)
- **Booleans** (`true` and `false`)
- **Numbers** (`-100`, `3.14`, and others)
- **BigInts** (uncommon and new)
- **Strings** (`"hello"`, `"abracadabra"`, and others)
- **Symbols** (uncommon)
- **Objects** (`{}` and others)
- **Functions** (`x => x * 2` and others)

Who is the liar?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**null is the value that "lies" about its type.**

Concretely, `typeof(null)` is `"object"` even though **null is [not](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-null-type) an object**. Null is a primitive value. (Here’s a [historical note](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html) on how that happened.) This is a very old bug in JavaScript. It cannot be fixed because fixing it would break a lot of existing code that, for better or worse, already relies on this quirk.

You might ask: isn’t `typeof([]) === "object"` a bug? No. Arrays aren’t primitive, so they are objects! So are dates, and everything not on our list. Unlike null, they’re telling the truth.

<Prompt>

## A Type of a Type

No matter what `value` we pick, we know that `typeof(value)` can only give us one of the several predetermined answers like `"number"`, `"string"`, and so on. What can we say with a similar certainty about `typeof(typeof(value))`?

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**`typeof(typeof(value))` is always `"string"`.**

Here’s why. We know `typeof(value)` always gives us one of the predetermined strings: `"undefined"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, and so on. Predetermined *strings*.

So `typeof` any of them is `"string"`. Because they’re strings!

If you struggle with this idea, perhaps, you’re not reading this code in the right order. Nesting means that the `typeof` “inside” executes _before_ the `typeof` “outside”, like so:

```
// This is the typeof() inside:
let type1 = typeof(value);
// It could be "number", "string", "object", ...
// But these are all strings!

// This is the typeof() outside:
let type2 = typeof(type1);
// It is "string" because type1 is a string!
```
