You might find it difficult unless you put one of them somewhere temporarily. Hint: in code, that \"somewhere\" can be a variable.\n\n```js\nlet singer = { surname: 'Turer' };\nlet pilot = { surname: 'Kamal' };\n// ??? line 1 ???\n// ??? line 2 ???\n// ??? line 3 ???\nconsole.log(singer.surname); // \"Kamal\"\nconsole.log(pilot.surname); // \"Turner\"\n```",

We can only change where one of them points at a time.\n\nHowever, we can introduce a variable to \"hold onto\" the value of one of those wires. Then we can change where that wire points to without \"forgetting\" where the other wire needs to be pointed.\n\nThis is similar to how in order to swap two things in your hands, you can give the first thing to your friend to hold, put the second thing in the first hand, and then take the first thing back from your friend.\n\nIf you're still confused, you can sketch out this example step by step.\n\n```js\nlet singer = { surname: 'Turner' };\nlet pilot = { surname: 'Kamal' };\nlet savedSingerSurname = singer.surname;\nsinger.surname = pilot.surname;\npilot.surname = savedSingerSurname;\nconsole.log(singer.surname) // \"Kamal\"\nconsole.log(pilot.surname) // \"Turner\"\n```"
