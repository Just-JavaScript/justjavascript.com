        "Imagine you see some code that checks whether a value is a date: <br/> `typeof(value) === 'date'` <br/><br/> Will this code work? Why or why not?",
      explanation:
        '### Answer: `typeof(value) === "date"` is always `false` \
\n\
This is because `date` is not one of the possible `typeof` results. Dates are not one of the primitive types (unlike numbers and booleans), and they are also not functions. So `typeof` for a date is always going to be `object`.',
