Hey there!

I'm Dan Abramov.

During my first few years of using JavaScript, I felt like a fraud.

Even though I could build websites with frameworks, something was missing. I dreaded JavaScript job interviews because I didn't have a solid grasp on fundamentals.

The existing courses never felt quite right.

Some of them are visual and easy to follow, but sacrifice too many important nuances. Others were more thorough, but I couldn't get through them without falling asleep because they are tedious and boring.

They just don't work for me.

What if there were an online course that could better prepare you to understand JavaScript, but wasn't a grueling march to get through?

**Just JavaScript**Â is that course.

The one I wish I had.

If you already know at least the basics of JS, Just JavaScript will help you feel more confident in your knowledge as a developer.

Just JavaScript is **my distilled mental model of how JavaScript works** and a collaboration with [Maggie Appleton](https://illustrated.dev).

Her visual story telling skills will help further our understanding, give us a frame of reference, and provide clarity to these mental models.

We want to share that clarity with you.
