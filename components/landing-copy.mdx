When you least suspect it, in an interstellar burst, it hits you.

The JavaScript universe throws you a curveball you weren't expecting.

It might be in an interview, or when you're pairing with another developer.

You're frozen.

Textbook knowledge doesn't prepare you for this moment.

Pure syntax won't solve the problem at hand.

<div className="text-center sm:py-16 py-8">
  <strong className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center font-serif font-bold">
    Don't panic.
  </strong>
</div>

When encountering the unfamiliar, take a step back and take stock of what you know.

- You _know_ JavaScript. Sort of.

- You know which parts of JavaScript are good, and which parts are... not so great.

- You can write applications, and they usually work.

Recognizing these facts sheds some light on the situation:

<div className="text-center sm:py-16 py-8">
  <strong className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center font-serif font-semibold leading-tighter">
    <span>
      You <span className="">can build</span> in JavaScript,
    </span>
    <span className="block ">
      but you <span className="font-extrabold">can't think in JavaScript.</span>
    </span>
  </strong>
</div>

This is what separates the Junior developer from the Senior. The experienced from the expert.

There's space between JavaScript's technical details and how to assemble pieces that solve real problems for real users.

<div className="text-center sm:py-16 py-8">
  <strong className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center font-serif font-semibold leading-tighter">
    You know you can bridge this gap, but you{' '}
    <span className="font-extrabold text-black">don't have time.</span>
  </strong>
</div>

Or rather, you don't have time to spare.

Do you spend what time you do have reading dry, twelve-hundred page specs? These won't help you apply syntax into the context of your real job (or the job you wish you had).

Watching 40 hours of video might yield ten useful minutes- you'll just have to skip over the intros and try your best to not to fast forward too far.

Neither of these alone will uncover the secret to filling the void.

A different sort of problem requires a different sort of solution.

One that's not just text, and not just video.

<div className="text-center sm:py-16 py-8">
  <strong className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center font-serif font-bold leading-tighter">
    Just JavaScript.
  </strong>
</div>

<strong className="block text-xl font-sans text-left leading-normal pb-8">
  Deep beneath your understanding of JavaScript's syntax is a set of mental
  models you've unconsciously built.
</strong>

They're the way you think all the parts of JavaScript fit together.

Every time you go about assembling variables, functions, and expressions – hoping to produce programs that solve real-world problems – your invisible models are running the show.

They're dictating how you compose your code. Where you store things. How you pass references around.

When we build software we aren't trying to create the most beautiful, eloquent JavaScript applications. We're focused on delivering real value to users in a way that is efficient and as error free as possible.

<strong className="block text-xl font-sans text-left leading-normal py-8">
  Just JavaScript has been crafted to help you do just that.
</strong>

Just JavaScript is a learning experience that goes far beyond boring syntax. You'll be able to use your knowledge to solve real problems with the language.

<div className="text-center sm:py-14 py-8">
  <div className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center max-w-xl mx-auto font-serif font-bold leading-tighter">
    It's <span className="font-extrabold">not</span> a course about clean code
    or tips and tricks.
  </div>
</div>

This course will help you think and reason more clearly about the software that you write and how you can approach problems in an effective and efficient manner.

<div className="text-center sm:py-14 py-8">
  <strong className="sm:text-4xl text-3xl text-center font-serif font-semibold leading-tighter">
    Just JavaScript is designed to give you{' '}
    <span className="font-extrabold">confidence in your abilities.</span>
  </strong>
</div>

This isn't a course created for beginners. It goes well beyond the basics. It is your key to unlock the gates and advance your career as a developer.

- No more doubting yourself before an interview
- No more frantic panic when you're assigned a critical bug fix
- No more cold sweats before submitting a PR to a senior developer

And gaining these new abilities won't even feel like a chore.

You won't be reading walls of text or sitting through hours of video.

Every lesson is built around animated explanations that walk you through the concepts.

You'll immediately put your understanding to the test with interactive quizzes baked into every lesson.
