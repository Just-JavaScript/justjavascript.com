## Copy That

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
const spreadsheet = { title: 'Sales' };
const copy = spreadsheet;
copy.title = copy.title + ' (Copy)';

console.log(spreadsheet.title); // ???
```

Then, **use your diagram** to figure out what the code will print on the last line, and write the result into the input box at the bottom.

If this code produces an error, write "error" as an answer.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"Sales (Copy)"`.**

We have two variables (`spreadsheet` and `copy`) pointing to the same object. We mutated that object’s `title` property. So both `spreadsheet.title` and `copy.title` will give us the updated value.

Note that although we declared both variables with `const`, it is not an error to mutate the object they point at. Const only prevents variable reassignment, not object mutation!

## Gotham, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let batman = {
  address: { city: 'Gotham' }
};
let robin = {
  address: batman.address
};
batman.address = { city: 'Ibiza' };

console.log(robin.address.city); // ???
```

Then, **use your diagram** to figure out what the code will print on the last line, and write the result as an answer.

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"Gotham"`.**

When we declared `robin`, we pointed its `address` property to the value of `batman.address` at the time of that declaration. That was an object whose `city` property was `"Gotham"`.

Since that point, we haven’t reassigned the `robin` variable and haven’t mutated the object reachable by `robin.address`. So `robin.address.city` is still `"Gotham"` by the end.

If you have trouble following this, remember to read every line of code step by step as you draw the diagram.

## Then I Flew Over the Ocean

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let chip = {
  address: { city: 'Disneyland' }
};
let dale = {
  address: {
    city: chip.address.city
  }
};
chip.address = { city: 'Tokyo' };

console.log(dale.address.city); // ???
```

</Prompt>

Then, **use your diagram** to figure out what the code will print on the last line, and write the result as an answer.

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"Disneyland"`.**

When we declared `dale`, we pointed `dale.address.city` to `"Disneyland"`, because that was the value of `chip.address.city` at that time.

We mutated the object `chip` points to by changing its `address` property later, but neither of the wires in the `dale.address.city` chain were affected by this change.

So `dale.address.city` is still `"Disneyland"`.

*(You’ll probably also have a second “abandoned” object pointing at `"Disneyland"`. There is no way to reach it by following the wires, so we omitted it from the diagram.)*

console.log(music.taste); // "classical"
onion.taste = 'umami';
console.log(music.taste); // "umami"

### Which diagram matches your drawing the best?

Remember we want to describe the universe **before** this code ran.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is the correct answer.**

Diagram A is wrong because it shows `music` and `onion` pointing to different objects. However, we know **they must have been pointing to the same object,** since mutating `onion.taste` affected `music.taste`.

## Happily Ever After

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let ilana = {
  address: { city: 'New York' }
};
let place = ilana.address;
place = { city: 'Boulder' };

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"New York"`.**

In this example, no objects were mutated at all, and the `ilana` variable was not reassigned. So `ilana.address.city` stays the same throughout the code snippet, with its original value being `"New York"`.

## More Worlds, More Problems

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let rick = {
  address: { city: 'C-137' }
};
let morty = {
  address: rick.address

Then, **use your diagram** to figure out what the code will print on the last line, and write the result as an answer.

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"C-137"`.**

In this example, `morty.address` initially points to the same object as the object that `rick.address` points to. That object’s `city` property points at `"C-137"`.

Later, we mutate the object `rick` points to, and change its `address` property. However, that object is not a part of the `morty.address.city` chain, so `morty.address.city` still gives us the initial `"C-137"` value.

### Which diagram matches your drawing the best?

Remember we want to describe the universe **before** this code ran.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram A is the correct answer.**

Diagram B is wrong because it shows `burger` and `rapper` pointing at the same object before the code runs. However, if that were the case, then assigning `burger = rapper` wouldn’t do anything. But we know that `burger.beef` has changed after the variable reassignment. So these variables must have been pointing at different objects in the beginning.

## Sick Sad World

Now we’re going to predict the future for a few more questions. They might seem a bit repetitive, but there are important variations in them, so pay attention!

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let daria = {
  address: { city: 'Lawndale' }
};
let place = daria.address;
place.city = 'L.A.';
let jane = {
  address: place
};

console.log(daria.address.city); // ???
```

Then, **use your diagram** to figure out what the code will print on the last line, and write the result as an answer.

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"L. A."`.**

We initialized the `place` variable to point to the same object that `daria.address` was already pointing to. Then we mutated that object by setting its `city` property to `'L. A.'`. As a result, `daria.address.city` gives us `'L. A.'` in the end.

## Say My Name

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

let gustavo = {
  address: walter.address

walter = {

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"Albuquerque"`.**

We initialized `gustavo.address` to point to where `walter.address` was pointing to initially, which is `{ city: 'Albuquerque' }`.

Later we changed where the `walter` variable wire points. However, that doesn’t affect the `gustavo` variable and isn’t an object mutation, so `gustavo.address.city` is still `'Albuquerque'`.

## Sev’ral Timez

First, **sketch a diagram** of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

let dipper = {
  address: {
    city: { name: 'Gravity Falls' }
  }
};

let mabel = {

Don’t skip drawing the diagram. The answer will include it. Pay close attention to what the last line is asking!

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The last line will print `"Land of Ooo"`.**

When we declared `mabel`, we pointed `mabel.address` to the same object that `dipper.address` was pointing to.

Then, we mutated that object — we set its `city` property to `{ name: 'Land of Ooo' }`.

So when we read `mabel.address.city.name`, it gives us that object’s `name` property value, which is `'Land of Ooo'`.

## Good Charlotte

Like Sherlock, you are a consulting detective. The JavaScript police needs your help. They have three theories of what the universe was like **before** this code ran.

Two of these theories are plausible. One of them is probably wrong. Choose **which one of these theories is probably wrong**. Prepare to explain why, too.

```js
// ???
console.log(charlotte.mother.age); // 20
console.log(charlotte.child.age); // 20

charlotte.mother.age = 21;

console.log(charlotte.mother.age); // 21
console.log(charlotte.child.age); // 21
```

Hint: Use the console logs as clues to solve your case.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The diagram B is the probably wrong one.**

We changed `charlotte.mother.age`, and saw the change reflected in `charlotte.child.age`.

The most likely explanation is that `charlotte.mother` and `charlotte.child` point to the same object. Both diagrams A show C had `charlotte.mother` and `charlotte.child` pointing to the same object.

However, the diagram B shows them pointing at different objects. So diagram B is **the probably wrong one.**

Keep in mind that our theories are only as good as our mental models. It is not impossible that diagram B would be correct, but we haven’t covered the relatively uncommon cases in which that could happen yet.
