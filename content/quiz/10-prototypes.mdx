### Which one of these diagrams best matches your sketch and our mental model after that code runs?

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram C is correct.**

Diagram A is wrong because it shows `lie` and `cake` pointing to the same object. However, they should point to two separate objects because each time we write `{ }`, we create a different object.

Diagram B is wrong because the special `__proto__` wire points to a variable. However, wires can never point to variables. They always point to values.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows both objects having a `taste` property. However, the object that `cake` points to doesn’t have a `taste` property. We never defined or assigned it.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The answers are `false`, `true`, `false`.**

`cake === lie`:

This is `false` because `cake` and `lie` point to two different objects.

`cake.taste === lie.taste`:

This is `true` because the value of `cake.taste` is `"bitter"` (we found it via the prototype), and the value of `lie.taste` is also `"bitter"` (we found it on the object itself). Each distinct string value only exists once, so the left and the right sides are equal.

`cake.hasOwnProperty('taste') === lie.hasOwnProperty('taste')`:

This is `false`. Remember that `hasOwnProperty` is asking: "Does this object have a property wire with that name?"

On the left side, `cake.hasOwnProperty('taste')` is `false` because the object that `cake` points to has no own `taste` property. On the right side, `lie.hasOwnProperty('taste')` is `true` because the object that `lie` points to *does* have a `taste` property.

So we have `false === true`, which is itself `false`.

<Answer>

**Diagram C is the correct answer.**

Diagrams A and B are wrong because they show the object `cake` points to having its own `taste` property. However, we never declared or assigned this property on that object.

Diagram D is wrong because it shows both variables pointing at the same object. However, each variable pointed to a different newly created object in the beginning, and neither variable has been reassigned since then.

2. `cake.taste`: This is also `"butter"`. The object that `cake` points to doesn’t have a `taste` property, so we continue searching for it on its prototype. Its prototype has a `taste` property, so its value is the result.

Only one of these diagrams matches our mental model. Before you confirm your choice, think about what’s wrong with the others.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**Diagram B is the correct answer.**

Diagram A is wrong because it shows `miles` pointing to an object with `legs` property still pointing to `8`. However, we’ve assigned `miles.legs` to `2`, which mutated the object that `miles` points to. So the `legs` property of that object should be pointing to `2` now.

Diagram C is wrong because it shows `spider.legs` pointing at `2`. However, the object that `spider` points to has not been mutated, and originally `spider.legs` was `8`. So it should have stayed set to `8`.

We only look at the prototype when we *read* properties that don’t exist. But when we *write* a property that doesn’t exist, we write it on the object itself. So when we write `miles.legs`, it creates a `legs` property on the object that `miles` points to. The prototype is not involved.

Diagram D is wrong for a similar reason as Diagram C. We did not mutate `spider.legs`, and assigning `2` to `miles.legs` did not affect the object that `spider` points to. So `spider.legs` should still be `8`.

<Answer>

**The answers are `8` and `2`.**

1. `spider.legs`: This is `8` because the object `spider` points to has its own `legs` property pointing to 8.

2. `miles.legs`: This is `2` because the object `miles` points to has its own `legs` property pointing to `2`. Although it has a prototype, we don’t look at it because we’ve already found our property.

## Tangled Web

Sketch a diagram of variables and values after this snippet of code runs.

```js
let spider = {
  legs: 8
};

let miles = {
  __proto__: spider
};

let gwen = {
  __proto__: spider
};

miles.legs = 2;
spider.legs = gwen.legs * 2;

console.log(gwen.legs) // ???
```

**Use our mental model.**

Then use your diagram to answer the question at the bottom of the code snippet.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The answer is `16`.**

First, when we executed `miles.legs = 2`, that didn’t affect `spider` or `gwen`. So this step doesn’t influence our final result.

When we execute `spider.legs = gwen.legs * 2,` we need to remember to do it in three steps:

**Step 1: Figure out the wire on the left: `spider.legs`.**

That’s the `legs` property of the object that the `spider` variable points to.

**Step 2: Figure out the value on the right: `gwen.legs * 2`.**

To figure out the value of `gwen.legs`, we follow the `gwen` wire. That object has no `legs` property, so we continue the search on its prototype. We find the `legs` property pointing at `8` there. So at this moment, `gwen.legs` is `8`, and thus `gwen.legs * 2` is `16`.

**Step 3: Point the wire from the first step at the value from the second step.**

We point `spider.legs` at `16`.

**Finally, we log `gwen.legs`.**

The object that `gwen` points at doesn’t have a `legs` property, so we continue the search on its prototype. We find the `legs` property there, pointing at `16`. That’s our answer.

## All Geese Go to Heaven

The second line of this code is a mystery. You have two tasks:

1. Draw the universe right after the second line
2. Figure out how the second line really ends


```js
let goose = {location: 'heaven'};
let cheese = // ???
// >>> Diagram this moment! <<<

console.log(cheese === goose); // false
console.log(cheese.location); // "heaven"

goose.location = 'hell';
console.log(cheese.location); // "hell"
```

This might be a bit confusing at first, so don’t rush. Approach it like a detective and use console logs as clues in your case.

After you're finished, **write the ??? part in the answer field**.

</Prompt>

<Answer>

**The simplest answer is `{ __proto__: goose }`.**

Let’s see how we can use the clues. Because `cheese === goose` was `false`, we know these variables point at different values. We also know that `cheese` pointed to an object because we were able to read `cheese.location`.

Later, we mutated `goose.location`. However, we’ve seen `cheese.location` change as a result. One explanation could be that they point at the same value. However, we’ve already established earlier that they must point at different values.

So the simplest explanation we have left is that `goose` points at `cheese` object’s prototype. This explains why when we mutated `goose.location` we could “see” it via `cheese.location`. The object that `cheese` points at doesn't have its own `location` property, so changes to its prototype's `location` property can be seen through it.
