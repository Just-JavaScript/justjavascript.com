Read this code:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a;
a = 0;
```

What are the values of `a` and `b` after it runs? Work it out in your head before reading further.

If you’ve been writing JavaScript for a while, you might object: “This snippet is much simpler than the code I’m writing every day. What’s the point?”

The goal of this exercise isn’t to introduce you to variables. We assume you’re already familiar with them. Instead, it is to make you notice and reflect on your *mental model*.

## What’s a Mental Model?

Read the code above again with an intention to *really be sure* what the result is. (We’ll see why this intention is important a bit later.)

While you’re reading it for the second time, pay close attention to what’s happening in your head, step by step. You might notice a monologue like this:

- `let a = 10;`
  - Declare a variable called `a`. Set it to `10`.
- `let b = a;`
  - Declare a variable called `b`. Set it to `a`.
  - Wait, what’s `a` again? Ah, it was `10`. So `b` is `10` too.
- `a = 0;`
  - Set the `a` variable to `0`.
- So `a` is `0` now, and `b` is `10`. That’s our answer.
