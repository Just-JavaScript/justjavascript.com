## Thanks

We want to thank you for reading our book, and pouring your energy into this course. We hope that it has helped you build (or rebuild) your JavaScript universe in a way that makes sense of the computed world around you.

## Just JavaScript Beginnings

Just JavaScript has been a long time in the making. We’ve been discussing the project with [Maggie](http://maggieappleton.com/) (who made all of the gorgeous illustrations!) since November 2018 — way before we decided on the name or the vision.

Throughout 2019, we brainstormed it together, trying out different visual metaphors and prototyping how to explain more complex concepts. We had a vision but did not have a clear plan, and the project stalled.

In September 2019, the final project name came to me in the shower, and I became determined to make Just JavaScript a reality. Although our original vision was an interactive learning playground, we scoped it down to an illustrated book for the first edition. We needed to get something out.

### The Email List

I started writing Just JavaScript as a book, and guess what? Writing is hard. I had many doubts about the order and pacing of the modules, and by the time I finished writing the first drafts, I knew they were absolutely no good; I was repulsed by them.

By the end of 2019, we knew that if we didn’t make the next move, the project would die. This is when we decided to start the email list. Ostensibly, our goal was to test our course on real people and verify that our approach wasn’t an outlandish fantasy that only made sense to the two of us.

But to me personally, the goal of the email list was also to force myself to finish *something* — even if it didn’t represent our full vision. I made the signup form and soon enough, we had our first subscribers. Now we had no choice but to send something to them! There was no way back.

Although I planned to send the original drafts one by one, I disliked them so much that I didn’t use them at all. Instead, I wrote every module from scratch. The crucial difference was that I had readers — people like you — who made all the difference. I am deeply thankful for the letters, stories, and thoughts they shared.

(And the occasional jerks — well, screw them, haha.)

The email list started as a way to break my procrastination. We never expected that it would grow to more than 85 thousand readers **and a *million* emails sent**. We are grateful to [Egghead](https://egghead.io/) who kept the lights on - we couldn’t have afforded running such a massive free email list ourselves.

### Endings and Beginnings

Originally, our plan was to cover a few more topics in the scope of the email list.

We covered different types of values, variables, objects, properties, mutation, and prototypes, but there was so much more to talk about! Even if we focused on fundamentals, we hadn't yet discussed the order in which the code runs, how function calls and `this` work, or the mental model for closures.

However, while the email format was a blessing at first, it outlived its use. Many of our readers wrote that they found emails inconvenient, and preferred reading long-form content outside of the mailbox. For every module, we spent a lot of time tweaking the length so that email clients didn’t clip the content. Many of our emails fell into spam folders or failed to be delivered. The service we used for quizzes would crash sometimes, and the images were too small because of layout constraints. It became clear to us that the format was not sustainable.

### Illustrated Book

Thanks to the first edition of email drafts, we felt confident in Just JavaScript. The support from our readers showed us that it is not a fantasy. It is real. You're reading our first step into this reality - a project that deserved to be more than rough drafts split into emails.

### Future work

Our hope is that Just JavaScript continues to grow - we want to iterate faster so that someday it becomes more than a book with pictures. There is a lot of work ahead, but we want to stop for a moment to say

** Thank You **

Thank you for your patience and support. Thank you for your questions and your feedback. We hope that you’ve learned something fun, useful, or both. Please don’t hesitate to reply one more time with your feelings and thoughts. We love to hear from you.

You've reached the end of this phase of our project, but don't worry - we're still hard at work, and the JavaScript universe is still there. One day, we’ll ask you if you want to visit it again.

We hope you’ll say yes.
