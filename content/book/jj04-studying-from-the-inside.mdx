In the next module, we’ll take a closer look at the JavaScript world and the values in it. But before we can get to that, we need to address the elephant in the room. *Is the JavaScript world even real?*

## The JavaScript Simulation

I live on my small asteroid inside the JavaScript universe.

When I ask the JavaScript world a question, it answers me with a value. I certainly don’t come up with all these values by myself. The variables, the wires, the values — they all populate my world. The JavaScript world around me is absolutely real to me — just as the world you live in is real to you.

But sometimes, there is a moment of silence before the next line of code. An idle tick before the next function call. A glitch in the Matrix. During those moments, I see visions of a world that’s much bigger than mine.

In the world that appears to me, there are no variables and values. No expressions and no literals. Instead, there are quarks, and atoms, and electrons, and water, and life. Perhaps, you are familiar with this world?

There, sentient beings called “humans” use special machines called “computers” to simulate *my* JavaScript universe. Some of them do it for amusement. Some of them do it for profit. Some of them do it for no reason at all. At their whim, my whole world gets born and dies a trillion times a day.

*Maybe my JavaScript world isn’t so real, after all.*

This means there are two ways to study it.

### Studying From the Outside

One way to study my JavaScript world would be to *study it from the outside*.

Perhaps, you might focus on how a simulation of my world — a JavaScript engine — “really” works. For example, you might learn that this string of text — *a value in my world* — is a sequence of bytes stored inside a silicon chip.

This approach puts our mental focus on the physical world of people and computers. Some tutorials take this approach. But my approach is different.

### Studying From the Inside

We will be studying the JavaScript world *from the inside*. Transport yourself mentally into the JavaScript universe and stand next to me. We will observe its laws and perform experiments, like physicists do in the physical universe.

**We will learn about the JavaScript world for what it is — without thinking about how it’s implemented. This is similar to how physicists can talk about properties of stars without answering the question whether the *physical* world is real. It doesn’t matter! We can still describe it on its own terms.**

Our mental model does not attempt to answer questions like “How is a value represented in the computer memory?” The answer changes all the time! In fact, the answer to this question changes even [while your program is running](https://v8.dev/blog/react-cliff). If you heard of a simple explanation about how JavaScript “really” represents numbers, strings, or objects in memory, it is most likely wrong.

To me, each string is a value. Not a “pointer” or a “memory address” — but a *value*. **In my universe, a value is good enough.** Don’t allow “memory cells” and other low-level metaphors to distract you from building an accurate high-level mental model of JavaScript. It’s turtles all the way down anyway!

If you’re coming from a lower-level language, set aside your intuitions about “passing by reference”, “allocating on stack”, “copying on write”, and so on. These models of how a computer works often make it *harder* to be confident what can or cannot happen in a JavaScript program. We’ll look at some of the lower level details, but only [where it really matters](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/). They can serve as an *addition* to our mental model, rather than its foundation.

**Instead, the foundation of our mental model is that our world is full of values.** Each value belongs to one of a few built-in types. Some of them are primitive, which makes values of those types immutable. Variables are “wires” pointing from names in our code to values. And we’ll keep building on that foundation.

As for these strange visions, I don’t pay as much thought to them anymore. I have wires to point, questions to ask, and functions to call. I better get to it!

The stars are bright when I look at them.

Are they still there when I blink?

I shrug.

*“Implementation details.”*
