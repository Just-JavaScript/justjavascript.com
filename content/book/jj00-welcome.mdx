Hi,

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my course, Just JavaScript.

Right now the course is [explanation of V2 here]. We hope to eventually expand the curriculum to include [explanation of V3].

The course is meant to be explored in stages, one module at a time, starting with *Mental Models*. Each module stands on its own and has exercises to help you solidify your learning at each step.

Along the way, I've been collaborating with Maggie Appleton, so you can expect some fun and interesting visuals to accompany the modules!

This course is a tour of my understanding of JavaScript and the mental models involved with writing computer programs in JavaScript. It has come together over many iterations, and we're always looking to improve it, so I would love to hear any feedback or questions that you might have.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Dan
