Hi,

Thank you so much for volunteering to read the draft of my course, Just JavaScript.

Right now the course is a sequence of mails that I will be drafting and sending to you over the next several months.

There's no charge, but I would like to ask that you respond with any feedback or questions that you might have.

This is a **rough draft** and I'm not spending too much time and care editing and polishing the manuscript.

You'll receive the **full sequence of emails** for this draft, a module at a time starting tomorrow with *Mental Models*. The rest of the modules will follow.

It's a raw and relatively unfiltered tour of my understanding of JavaScript and the mental models involved with writing computer programs in JavaScript.

Along the way, I've been collaborating with Maggie Appleton, so you can expect some fun and interesting visuals to accompany the manuscripts!

_Please note that this course assumes you have some experience with JavaScript and isn't intended for the complete novice._

I hope you enjoy it.

Cheers,

Dan

PS Ready to get the first email about Mental Models right now? Just <a href="https://justjavascript.com/excited" trigger-id="1429505">click here</a> and I'll send it right away! If not, it will arrive tomorrow.
